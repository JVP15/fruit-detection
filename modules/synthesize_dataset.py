Our models perform well on their respective datasets, but there is a problem. When the ripeness and defect modules are applied
to real-world images, they tend to perform poorly. This is because the models weren't trained on images of fruit with an orchard background.

To solve this problem, we can synthesize a dataset of images with an orchard background. We can then train the models on this dataset.
Our synthesize algorithm is as follows:

1. We take an image from the ripeness or defect dataset
2. We use the Fruit Detection Module to localize the fruit in the image (we only want one fruit, so we'll just take the biggest bounding box)
3. We use Grab-Cut by OpenCV to segment the fruit from the background
4. We pick a random image from one of the detection datasets (which are all taken in an orchard)
5. We select a random bounding box from the image and extract it (the bounding box must be bigger than a threshold; if there are no bounding boxes that are large enough, we randomly pick a different image)
6. We normalize the mean and standard deviation of the segmented fruit to match the mean and standard deviation of image inside the bounding box
7. We paste the fruit into the bounding box and save the resulting image
8. We repeat steps 1-7 until we have enough images

This way, we can train our models on images that are more similar to the images that they will be applied to in the real world.
